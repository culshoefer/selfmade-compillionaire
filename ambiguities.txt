EXAMPLE:
Paragraph: 72
Problem: it is not clear whether we can omit both the start and end indices
in sequence slicing, like "foo = bar[:]".
Our solution: this is possible in many other languages that support list
slicing (like Python), so our compiler accepts this syntax.

Paragraph: 17
Problem: It's ambiguous whether variables can be declared without initialisation.
Our solution: The wording in the paragraph suggests that it is possible so we're assuming it is. (TODO: Update)

Paragraph: 5
Problem: It's unclear exactly which single-quote character is meant in the definition of a char. 
Our solution: For simplicity, we only go with ASCII 39 ('), the character used to denote character literals in Java

Paragraph: 16
Problem: It's not explicit whether functions may be completely empty (in the definition it says
'body consists of local variable declarations (if any), followed by statements', note that this
does not specify whether it's 0..* or 1..* statements)
Solution: We only allow non-empty functions (similar to Python). In particular, main is not allowed to be empty

Paragraph: 15
Problem: It's not clear whether one has to have parentheses around empty function parameter declarations,
or whether only the main function is allowed not to have parentheses around its parameter declaration, because it is a shiny snowflake.
Solution: TODO: Fix parameter declaration problem

Paragraph: 16
Problem: The syntax around print/read is not clear: Should there just be a single space after the keyword?
Solution: Yes. print and read require EXACTLY one space. Unlike Python, print() or read() is not allowed
