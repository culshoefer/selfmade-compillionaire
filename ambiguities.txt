EXAMPLE:
Paragraph: 72
Problem: it is not clear whether we can omit both the start and end indices
in sequence slicing, like "foo = bar[:]".
Our solution: this is possible in many other languages that support list
slicing (like Python), so our compiler accepts this syntax.

Paragraph: 17
Problem: It's ambiguous whether variables can be declared without initialisation.
Our solution: The wording in the paragraph suggests that it is possible so we're assuming it is. (TODO: Update)

Paragraph: 5
Problem: It's unclear exactly which single-quote character is meant in the definition of a char. 
Our solution: For simplicity, we only go with ASCII 39 ('), the character used to denote character literals in Java
